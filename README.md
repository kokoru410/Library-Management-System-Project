# Library-Management-System-Project
This project builds a fully functional Library Management System using MySQL. It covers database design, CRUD operations, multi-table JOINs, aggregate functions, date-based filtering, and CTAS across six interrelated tables — branch, employees, members, books, issued_status, and return_status.
